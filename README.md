# üßÄSindragosa CheeseüßÄ<br/>GUID 101<br/>

_Vivax (Pagle-US) -_ `Discfordge` _(Discord)_



Sindragosa, queen of the Frostbrood and final boss of the Frostwing Hall at the Icecrown Citadel (ICC), can be ‚Äúcheesed‚Äù. 

The ability [Icy Grip](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/spell=70117/icy-grip) can be avoided, and in this document, I explain in detail how to fully ignore it (making it so _**nobody**_ gets pulled) utilizing the Unique ID of Players (GUID), in the Classic version of World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King (as of February 2024).

## **SUMMARY**
### **Tl;dr**

**YOU WANT THE OLDEST CHARACTER IN YOUR RAID (LOWEST GUID) TO DO THE CHEESE.**

_(I don't know if it is possible for a caster to cheese this? yet? Sorry.)_

**YOU CAN CHECK THE GUIDs OF YOUR RAID YOURSELF AT https://wotlk-mage.herokuapp.com/**

-	30s into the fight and every 30s after each air phase, Sindragosa casts Icy Grip, which pulls (read: sucks) your raid into the boss hitbox. 

-	Whenever someone stands in the center of Sindragosa hitbox, _**most**_ of the raid will completely ignore the Icy Grip (this is the ‚Äúcheese‚Äù). However, sometimes some people get pulled despite the ‚Äúcheese‚Äù.

-	Who gets pulled or not into Sindragosa while doing the ‚Äúcheese‚Äù is based on the GUID of the character standing inside her hitbox (‚Äúthe cheeser‚Äù). To avoid _**everyone**_ from getting sucked into her hitbox, the person with the lowest/oldest GUID should be the one standing in the middle. Only those with a lower/older GUID relative to the ‚Äúcheeser‚Äù will be sucked into, and those with a higher/newer GUID won‚Äôt.


## **Background**

Ignoring Icy Grip has been known since 2010, when the raid and the encounter were first released, as seen in a [YT video explaining how to do the "cheese"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqIjp4BNY8c&t=37s) and its respective [forum post](https://www.ownedcore.com/forums/world-of-warcraft/world-of-warcraft-exploits/297916-how-avoid-icy-grip-before-blistering-cold-sindragosa.html).

The ‚Äúcheese‚Äù to ignore this mechanic entirely relies on a melee DPS <sup>or anyone? Not confirmed if a ranged DPS can do it, at least I haven‚Äôt confirmed this personally. Can someone check this? Thanks</sup> standing on the center of Sindragosa hitbox. This causes Icy Grip to not pull/suck your raid into her hitbox.

This by itself doesn‚Äôt guarantee _**everyone**_ in your raid from ignoring the mechanic, and these ‚Äúexceptions‚Äù are related to the GUID of the characters in your raid.
In short, if the lowest/oldest character in your raid stands under Sindragosa, nobody gets gripped.

## **Illustrated example (for kids)**

The following example is based on the following log:
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/ftk82FZgKnvW7rYd#fight=36

When not ‚Äúcheesing‚Äù Icy Grip, your entire raid gets pulled into Sindragosa. 
This leads to lower uptime (and lower DPS) across the entire raid.

In contrast, this is how it looks like when properly cheesing the mechanic. Only a few people get pulled into Sindragosa hitbox.

There is one thing to highlight here: 

There were five (5) players getting pulled/dragged into Sindragosa hitbox. 

This example has two (2) ‚Äúcheesers‚Äù (however, you can do this with one (1) cheeser and it will work just fine).

The five (5) players still getting gripped into Sindragosa hitbox are getting gripped despite the cheese because their GUIDs (or gameIDs) are lower/older than those of the players doing the ‚Äúcheese‚Äù.

As can be seen in the following table.

To the best of my knowledge, you can retrieve the GUIDs of your guild with the following command (in-game chat): 
```
/run g1={GetNumGuildMembers()};g2=tonumber(g1[1]);i=1 repeat local info={GetGuildRosterInfo(i)};if info[17]< UnitGUID("player")then print(info[1])print(info[17])end i=i+1 until i>g2
```
This will print most <sub>sometimes not all</sub> of the oldest/lowest GUIDs of your guild in your chat window.
You can then copy this information into an excel by using the add-on Prat (Select chat as text -> Ctrl + A -> Ctrl + C)

Alternatively, you can look up the gameID of the characters in your log with the [‚ÄúMage Analyzer‚Äù tool](https://wotlk-mage.herokuapp.com/), or directly from [woodchopper website](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/) API if [you know what you are doing.](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/api/docs)
